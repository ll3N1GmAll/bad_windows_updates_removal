List of updates removed with somw details gathered from online articles/sources:
KB3075249 – This update adds telemetry points to the User Account Control (UAC) feature to collect information on elevations that come from low integrity levels.
KB3080149 – This package updates the Diagnostics and Telemetry tracking service to existing devices. This service provides benefits from the latest version of Windows to systems that have not yet upgraded. The update also supports applications that are subscribed to Visual Studio Application Insights. So once both of these updates are installed on your computer then Microsoft may possibly spy on you in a similar way Microsoft Windows 10 does, and all your data will be sent to Microsoft servers.That is not all. Privacy-conscious users of Windows have pointed out that there are numerous other updates released by Microsoft that either grant the company an access to your data or forcefully updates your existing version of Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 to the latest operating system release, Windows 10.If you want to stick to Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 and want to remain untracked then we will recommend you to stay away from the following updates:
